# BC-DPM

This repository is heavily based on [improved diffusion](https://github.com/openai/improved-diffusion) and [guided diffusion](https://github.com/openai/guided-diffusion).

## Usage
Step1: 
    Train a diffusion model on normal dose images by running scripts/image_train.py. 

Step2:
    Sample high dose images from low dose images by running scripts/bc_dpm_sample.py.
